  /**

   * Exploit Overview
   *
   * Essentially the vuln here is in the Timelock Contract during the execute()
   * function. Firstly, it allows anyone to call it which gives us an entry point.
   * Secondly it executes the given commands, BEFORE checking that it is ready for execution.
   *
   * This means that we are able to schedule the command we are performing at the same time
   * as doing it so that once we complete our actions, the operation we just performed
   * was a valid operation ready for execution.
   *
   * So which commands do we need to schedule our own actions?
   *
   * 1. Set the Timelock Contract to have the PROPOSER role.
   * 2. Update delay of schedule execution to 0 to allow immediate execution
   * 3. Call to Vault contract to upgrade to malcious attacker controlled contract
   *      which allows setting the sweeper to anyone.
   * 4. Call to another attacker controlled contract to handle the scheduling and sweeping
   *
   * Once we generate the `to` and `data` values for the 4 calls above, we will need to
   * pass that to our attacking contract to store so we don't run into recursive issues.
   * This comes from the timelock contract being unable to schedule calls itself, nor being
   * able to pass the execution data to the contract at runtime as it will also run into
   * recursion isues.
   *
   * Then once the attacker controlled contract sweeps the funds, we run a withdraw()
   * on the contract to take the funds.
   *
   * Attacking contracts are available at:
   * "contracts/attacker-contracts/climber/*.sol"
